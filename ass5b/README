Hey prof,

Again, you have two options here.

You can enter "make" into the comand line then run ./par <N><T> and ./seq <N>.
They are both compiled with -pg so their gprof stats will be produced.

Alternatively, you can use the ./run script and it'll cycle through a variety
of inputs, appending the gprof stats to the files created by the script. It 
may take about 30 s to run.
